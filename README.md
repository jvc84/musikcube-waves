## Examples

### If you just want cava:

![plot](.doc/images/cava_example.png)

```
"custom/wayves": {
    "format": "{}",
    "exec": "python /PATH/TO/wayves/wayves.py -o cava -i cava -a cava"
},
```

### If you want mini waves to move when music is on:

![plot](.doc/images/waves_example.png)

```bash
"custom/wayves": {
    "format": "{}",
    "exec": "python /PATH/TO/wayves/wayves.py -p <PLAYER> -o flat=3 -i splash -a waves"
},
```

### If you want to separate left and right cava halves to put something in between:

![plot](.doc/images/double_cava_example.png)
- module for left audio channel:

```
"custom/wayves_left": {
    "format": "{}",
    "exec": "python /PATH/TO/wayves/wayves.py -o cava=left -i cava=left -a cava=left"
},
```

- some other modules

- module for right audio channel:

```
"custom/wayves_right": {
    "format": "{}",
    "exec": "python /PATH/TO/wayves/wayves.py -o cava=right -i cava=right -a cava=right"
},
```

### Maybe you just want a little cat to live in your bar:

![plot](.doc/images/cat_example.png)

```bash
"custom/wayves": {
    "format": "{}",
    "exec": "python /PATH/TO/wayves/wayves.py -o cat -i cat -a cat"
},

```

That's pretty much it. Put star if you like this module and send bug report if something is wrong.
